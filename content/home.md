### REQUEST FOR BALLOT

To:  RWPOA Members

As you know, we have been working for quite a while to revise our covenants due to outdated material and the desire of many members to change some of the provisions within the document.  We have finally been able to put together a ballot following the advice of our attorney.   As you know, former Secretary, Doug Harrison, posted on our old website those concerns, compiled those together, and came up with a rough draft for a new covenants document. 

 We have been in conference with our attorney and, upon further examination, have learned that because of state and local Association laws and practices, there are some clauses that, while we may view them as outdated (such as references to the private roads),  we may not delete without inadvertently nullifying the Homeowners Association altogether.  However, it is permissible by law to write an amendment to some of the rules within the document, such as fence styles, number of sheds, dogs, etc. With this in mind, we have made every effort to include the input we have received from members on our ballot for a vote.   

The ballot is the next step within the legal process to make amendments, and a response from everyone is necessary in order to make the changes.  We have designed it so that the original clause, as you have in your files, is presented first, under “Original provision as stated”, and then the changed version, “Proposed provision as stated”.  This is a line-by-line ballot, so some provisions might pass while others might not.  Once we tally the votes for each new provision, the board will determine if it is financially responsible to proceed with the amendments.  As some or all of these proposed changes could affect you personally, it is heartily advised that you insure that your voice is heard.

In closing, we know that Covid-19 has presented its challenges. Rest assured that we have been working behind the scenes to accomplish many of the objectives we have set out to do prior to the pandemic and will continue to do so in service to all of our members.  Stay safe, everyone.

Please return your ballot to: RWPOA, PO Box 661, Orange, Va. 22960 and write “Ballot” in the lower, left hand corner of the envelope.  Thank you!

**Mark Townley**\
President, RWPOA

## Sent to Membership August 5, 2020

The purpose of this note is to bring the full membership of the RWPOA up to speed on the selection of a new president. This document does not bring up any new information and is consistent with communications within the Board over recent months.
The presidency has been vacant since May when Stacy’s term expired. In anticipation of that, the Board had a meeting on Jan 25 to discuss a path forward. A further meeting was scheduled in April to finalize nominations followed by an election in May at the Annual Membership Meeting. Then the Coronavirus appeared and the Board had to navigate the Covid-19 landscape with the restrictions on meetings and assemblies.

In June, the Treasurer informed us that a prompt appointment of a president was needed to comply with legal restrictions for non-profit organizations. The Board took some unusual actions to address the problem. Our only qualified volunteer at that point was Mark Townley, and the Board proposed to the membership at large that Mark Townley take over the presidency for reasons that the following discussion should make apparent. An election is planned at next May’s annual meeting. There were no objections to the proposal.

The Board discussed at length, the qualifications to be president at the Jan 25 meeting. In Stacy’s 12 years as president, the role of the president has evolved significantly. Whereas, the president was formerly an administrative position, Stacy did far more than the minimum required. When a hurricane struck, he was available to recover the boats that became unmoored. When we were struck by a blizzard, Stacy plowed out the neighborhood. Stacy planned and executed maintenance as necessary on RWPOA facilities. Stacy also carried out the traditional presidential roles, chairing meetings, running elections and organizing community activities. The Board hoped to maintain the same level of activity and commitment with the new president. Some qualifications that were recommended follow:

1. The president should live in Rolling Woods permanently to be able to respond quickly to emergencies.

2. We hoped to find someone who could pick up on the maintenance chores that Stacy always completed in the past. (In the last couple of months, Mark has fixed the common area gate, fixed the main mailbox which was going to be removed by the post office, and repaired fencing in the common area).

3. The president has to stay in touch with the community, reading his emails religiously every day. (Mark is a committed individual. May assists with admin work. When May was Treasurer, the Association was solvent.) Mark is an excellent worker.

4. The President has to be liked and respected in the community. Everyone likes Mark thanks to his happy, cooperative demeanor.

None of the current officers meet all these criteria. Mark is well qualified to take over the presidency.

At the end of July, the Bodensteins arrived on the scene and claimed that Bob, in his former role as vice president, should be named president. They had purchased a permanent domicile in South Carolina a few years ago and had ceased to be active either on the Board or in the community. They did not respond to any of the numerous emails regarding the presidency during the previous months. No one had any idea that Bob was even interested in the presidency, but since the actions had already been taken, the objections were too late.

I hope this meets your needs. Please call me (703-795-5860) or any other Board member to discuss.

## Sent to Membership July 15, 2020

As many of you know, Stacy Ramsey is planning to retire as president of the Rolling Woods Property Owners Association. The Board has continued in operation through the Covid-19 crisis and, after much discussion, has concluded that an effective successor would be current Board Member, Mark Townley. He would succeed Stacy in a timely manner and pick up Stacy’s role in the organization. Mark has been very active and has contributed many hours to the RWPOA projects over the last couple of years.

The Board recommends that the membership approve Mark as our new president. We welcome membership comments. Due to the Covid-19 contagion, a full meeting will not be possible until the virus is controlled. (Board members have already had Covid-19 once and don’t want to have it again or transmit it to any other members.)

We realize that Stacy’s role will be very difficult to replace. He has done a tremendous amount of work for us in his 12 years as President. We thank Stacy for his service. His contracting organization has always gone out of its way to give us the best possible price on projects, and we thank Stacy for that.

Pete Barry has organized a volunteer corps to complete as many of Stacy’s work roles as possible. If you wish to volunteer, please contact Pete (571-451-5135) or Doug (703-795-5860). Mark has always been a leading member of the neighborhood volunteers. Joan and Doug Harrison will stay on in their roles as Treasurer and Secretary. The rest of the Board, consisting of Vice President Bob Bodenstein, David Loving. Terry Thornton, and Kyle Bennett will also continue in their roles. We will be needing another volunteer to replace Mark on the Board.

Given the current situation with Coronavirus, I'm afraid we have to indefinitely postpone the April 11 RWPOA Board Meeting and the May 2 RWPOA Membership Meeting. We'll reschedule for later in the summer when we have a better idea of what's happening.

Please review the Meeting Notes see the actions taken at the last meeting.

We remind all property owners that clearing blockage from the ditches along the roads is the responsibility of the property owners not the mowing contractor. When he reaches a point in the mowing area that's filled with debris he is allowed to bypass the area.

Algae:

Dear Doug,

LACA just learned that the Virginia Department of Health has issued a no swim advisory due to Harmful Algae Blooms (HAB) on the upper part of Lake Anna.

DEQ sampled 9 sites on Lake Anna on July 15th and VDH sampled the State Park. All samples were analyzed by ODU staff.

Three areas of the Lake contained cyanobacteria counts greater than 100,000 cells/ml. These sites include Upper North Anna Branch, Upper Pamunkey Branch and Terry's Run. These three area have been placed under a swimming advisory.

At six of the 10 tested sites, cyanobacteria toxins were detected, but were still well below the safe swimming levels.

To learn more, please go to VDH's [HAB Map](https://www.lakeannavirginia.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=tfZqi0WToxIIFFNEmu9yR87Em67lPXtsVA3Zw%2bDpjGRl8U6oR72pzZ68sYsHrX2Dn7MuaWF7O5MrbjL2pY0wz0O0D%2b%2fyqRCN2tg75z3WRGc%3d) or see the the [press release](https://www.lakeannavirginia.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=0Av7vRXE8wh3OX2USDmLHZp0z0sE4yEaLZQn%2bMBo4uknwzbCX5jLStq2%2fgavC1uCchDN0YnYs%2bt4g8gieEVDoGts0f2eg8BzUpfRd3IdC3c%3d).
