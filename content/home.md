Board meeting proposed for Sept 10, 2022 More to follow.

May 15th, 2022 11am
RWPOA ANNUAL MEETING
Notes
President Loving called the meeting to order at 11:05. Attendance was less than normal because of the double postponement and the fact that the meeting was held on a Sunday. Fulle meeting notes are posted in the Annual Meeting Notes section.

Board Elections
•	Jim Herdman and Pete Barry have resigned from the Board. The Board thanks them for their service. 
•	Cathy Hillyard was elected Vice President
•	Joan Harrison was elected Treasurer
•	Doug Harrison was elected Secretary
•	Millie Miller was elected to the Board
•	David Loving (President), Terry Thornton, and Kyle Bennett continue in their position on the Board

There are currently 7 Board members. The maximum is nine. We continue to solicit volunteers for the Board. 

Treasurer’s Report 

Joan presented the Treasurer’s Report with the Budget for 2022-3. The Report is shown in the full meeting notes.

Joan noted a significant number of delinquencies on dues even though only 3 are now chronic. Dave is working on collection.

There was discussion of the application of penalties for late payment. It was suggested that applying the penalty for as many years as a specific payment is late would provide an incentive for quicker payment. It was pointed out that the original application of penalties was done in that way and it had the opposite effect. More payments were delinquent. When we switched back to single penalty for a single late payment, delinquencies were reduced.

With dues now at $200/yr, the RWPOA is building up a reserve for replacement of the docks when it is deemed necessary. Joan had the contractor who built the Frazier’s Landing docks provide an estimate of the cost of replacement ($160,000). He also estimated the remaining life at 10 to 20 years. It appears that our current accumulation of funds will allow replacement of the docks when needed without special assessment, as long as we continue to replace bad boards as has been done for the past few years under Mark and Dave. 

Hardship can be requested to delay payment of dues. (Only 1 of the 3 long term delinquencies claimed hardship.) 

$3000 is being kept in reserve for road repair. 3 Bids were obtained on road repair with correction of drainage design error. Low bid was $1500 with supplemental gravel as contingency. Only the lower half of the drive needs work. 
**

Current Business

1.	Covenants Ballots: 48 Ballots received, need 64 yes votes to change anything. POA act takes precedence over by- laws. There was much discussion of tabulation of all covenant violations as a means of incenting more votes in favor of change. It was also noted that proposed simplification of the covenant rules would bring most into compliance. It was agreed that Dave would continue soliciting ballot approvals by discussing the potential benefits of simplification.

2.	Docks and Common Area: Docks: Bad boards replaced and stained. Cleaned up around the dock area and benches repaired and stained. Replaced broken ladder with new one provided by Terry Thornton. Many thanks to all the volunteers for their service.

3.	Many thanks to Pam and Terry Thornton for their years of service maintaining the front gardens.  They have done a wonderful job, but they both must step back as it is getting too much for them to maintain with their schedule.  We are looking for volunteers who might be interested in resuming what they have accomplished.

New Business

AirB&B’s

1.	AIRB&B: The law in Virginia is simple. An AIRB&B is a residential home and meets our current covenants.
2.	Fees for AirBnB for short rentals and common area use will be considered. It’s also important rental providers carry all liabilities, not the RWPOA. It was also suggested that rental providers also provide lists of users and cars to the RWPOA. No decision yet. Andy Feinstein pointed out that hedge are funds looking for neighborhoods in which to invest based on future rental income potential. Possibility of modifications to the Covenants will be considered. 
3.	The definition of “weekly” in the covenants is unclear.  
                                                                    
 Mailbox Area

The big pine tree has been removed. The bulletin board has been replaced. We will replace the roof before winter due to damage from January's winter storm.

Buoys 

We have purchased three new Buoys and will install them this month. 3rd Buoy will be a designated hazard zone.

Mowing

All residents are reminded that mowing is impossible if residents and owners do not remove debris from the mowing area.

Cameras 

Purchase and installation of 3 cameras, 1 at the gate and 2 at the docks has been approved.

Drainage

•	Drainage systems need to be surveyed for damage. It was questioned whether lot owners or VDOT are responsible.   
•	The VDOT Right of Way width was questioned.
•	Complaint filed for damage to properties during storm cleanup by FEMA contractor.
           

Port-a-potty 
Please do not leave dog droppings or bags anywhere in the common area (Including the port-a-potty.) 

Trash Cans
Now that there is trash service in the neighborhood, members are requested to move trash cans off the road on non-pickup days.

LUNCH

Thanks to all for the contributions to a great lunch

### REQUEST FOR BALLOT

To:  RWPOA Members

As you know, we have been working for quite a while to revise our covenants due to outdated material and the desire of many members to change some of the provisions within the document.  We have finally been able to put together a ballot following the advice of our attorney.   As you know, former Secretary, Doug Harrison, posted on our old website those concerns, compiled those together, and came up with a rough draft for a new covenants document. 

 We have been in conference with our attorney and, upon further examination, have learned that because of state and local Association laws and practices, there are some clauses that, while we may view them as outdated (such as references to the private roads),  we may not delete without inadvertently nullifying the Homeowners Association altogether.  However, it is permissible by law to write an amendment to some of the rules within the document, such as fence styles, number of sheds, dogs, etc. With this in mind, we have made every effort to include the input we have received from members on our ballot for a vote.   

The ballot is the next step within the legal process to make amendments, and a response from everyone is necessary in order to make the changes.  We have designed it so that the original clause, as you have in your files, is presented first, under “Original provision as stated”, and then the changed version, “Proposed provision as stated”.  This is a line-by-line ballot, so some provisions might pass while others might not.  Once we tally the votes for each new provision, the board will determine if it is financially responsible to proceed with the amendments.  As some or all of these proposed changes could affect you personally, it is heartily advised that you insure that your voice is heard.

In closing, we know that Covid-19 has presented its challenges. Rest assured that we have been working behind the scenes to accomplish many of the objectives we have set out to do prior to the pandemic and will continue to do so in service to all of our members.  Stay safe, everyone.

Please return your ballot to: RWPOA, PO Box 661, Orange, Va. 22960 and write “Ballot” in the lower, left hand corner of the envelope.  Thank you!

**David Loving**\
President, RWPOA

Please review the Meeting Notes see the actions taken at the last meeting.

We remind all property owners that clearing blockage from the ditches along the roads is the responsibility of the property owners not the mowing contractor. When he reaches a point in the mowing area that's filled with debris he is allowed to bypass the area.
